This Capstone project is based on the concept of booking movie ticket online.
There are 2 types of users :
  1) Super Admin
  2) Customer
Super admin creates and views different resources like Theatre, Movie, Shows, bookings using backend dashboard.
Where as user on the other hand login into system and gets redirected to movie-listing page where he/she can see all the shows listed there.
He/she can also filter shows based on Movie name and location and can book that particular show.

Admin Login:
Username : admin@simplilearn.in
Password: Admin@#2024


Please download the backend and frontend folder to setup Java Spring Boot and Angular application separately.
I have used Eureka server and micro service in this project.

Postman collections file and Database dump file are there so that you can use those files to verify endpoints and setup DB separately.
